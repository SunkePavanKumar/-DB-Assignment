**1. Relationship between Product and Product_Category**

The relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" entities in the provided schema is a **one-to-many relationship**. This means:

- A single **Product Category** can have many **Products** associated with it (think of clothing categories like "Shirts" having many different shirt products).
- A single **Product** can only belong to one **Product Category** (a specific shirt can't be in both "Shirts" and "Pants" categories).

This structure is reflected in the way our database tables are linked. The `Product` table likely has a field called `categoryId` that stores the ID of the corresponding `Product_Category`. This foreign key reference ensures that products are linked to valid categories.

**2.Enforcing Valid Category for Products**

There are two main ways to make sure each product has a valid category assigned:

**A. Mongoose Schema Validation:**

During schema definition in Mongoose, we can use validation to enforce the existence of a valid category ID:

```javascript
const productSchema = new Schema({
  categoryId: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "ProductCategory",
    required: true,
  },
});
```

This approach throws an error if a product is created without a valid category ID, preventing invalid data from entering the database.

**B. Business Logic Validation:**

Alternatively, we can implement validation logic in our application code before saving a product. This logic can check if the provided categoryId exists in the Product_Category collection:

```javascript
async function saveProduct(productData) {
  const categoryExists = await ProductCategory.findById(productData.categoryId);
  if (!categoryExists) {
    throw new Error("Invalid category ID provided");
  }
}
```
